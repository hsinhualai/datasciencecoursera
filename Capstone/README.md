## Capstone Project for the Johns Hopkins University Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone

### Text prediction Shiny application

- In this Capstone project, we build a text prediction Shiny application to predict the most probably word followed by a partial sentence provided by a User.

- The text data source is downloaded from the link, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip, in which there is one folder called en_USA that contains three text files from blogs, news, and twitters. We used the three text files for builing ngrams models.


- The complete R codes including preprocessing and building ngrams and predictions are inside the directory-- Ngram_ model _code

- The R codes for the Shiny app, please see ui.R and server.R files inside the directory Capstone_Project.

- The Shiny App is at: https://hsinhualai.shinyapps.io/Capstone_Project-Text_Prediction/

- The folder, Capstone_  Slide _Deck, contains the R codes for making the slides. The Slide Deck Presentation is at: https://rpubs.com/hsinhua/188463
